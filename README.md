# Contextual-Cueing-Unity
The classic contextual cueing paradigm for visual search (Chun and Jiang, 1998) in the Unity Gaming Engine. This implementation aims for high flexibility in the design of the search displays and will be continuously extended.

The experiment can be performed either directly on a computer with mouse and keyboard or by using a virtual reality headset. Display configurations, reaction times and (if VR is active) head movement data are stored individually in a /data/ folder. 

The number of repeated and randomly generated search displays can be set separately, as well as the total number of distractors and their placement in virtual space.
